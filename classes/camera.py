    The class which creates a camera view for the game which fallows the
    player on the x axes. The class does so by updating the x value of
    each objects drawn of the game_display. The position of the camera 
    view is determined by the position of player character position on x
    axes. The class is also able to fallow the player on y axes if one 
    wishes to. The idea for the camera was taken from here:
