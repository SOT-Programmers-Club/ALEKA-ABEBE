''' Background Class

The Class creates and blits a background which is then capable of 
parallax scrolling once camera Class starts updating the x values of 
each background object. The idea for the parallax background was take 
from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q7tmIlXROg

The class also randomises the images of the background.

# Creating information for each object which will be displayed on the

# The information is stored in a list of lists.
# as an example [increment, [x_position, y_position]].
# First parameter stores the increment of the scroll.
# The increment will be used to control the speed of the scroll for that
#  particular object.
# x_position is where the object will be blited on x axes.
# y_position is where the object will be blited on y axes.
