class Map:
    '''
    This class is used to generate and display the map. The map is 
    created with the use of a matrix. At the moment the matrix is hard 
    coded in function createGameMap() above the class however this will 
    changed to a method which generates the matrix dynamically. When the
    matrix is generated it is passed to a generateMap() method which 
    reiterates through the matrix and checks the values of each element 
    in it. Depending on the values of each element in the matrix the 
    generateMap() method adds the position, tile type and the surface to
    which the tile should be printed on to the pygame.sprite.Group saved
    in map_group variable. Then the map_group is the passed to the Tile
    class writen by Robert Soane. The idea of storing a map in to matrix
